Project Vision
FOR students in universities WHO want to switch from Slack or Discord because Slack has become a paid service and Discord has a file size limit THE StudySphere IS A communication service THAT has no forced subscription and higher file size limits.
UNLIKE Slack, Discord and Zoom OUR PRODUCT will have interactive lectures that could replace zoom calls during situations like covid.
A collaborative notes section where students and lecturers can share notes amongst each other. StudySphere will also have a task scheduler where students and lecturers can plan tasks that need to be completed in a specific time frame.

Amended Feature List (changes are highlighted in yellow)
Account Management:
Users can create/delete an account.
Universities/Colleges can register on Studysphere, allowing them to create accounts for students and lecturers, or register existing accounts as a member of said university/college.
This allows universities/colleges to verify that a lecturer’s account is real, and that they work for that university/college.
StudySphere will make it simpler to automate setting up accounts for students and lecturers, to stand out against its competitors.

Basic User Abilities:
Users are able to post messages for other users to see.
Users can view messages from other users.
Users can directly message other users in the same channel.
Users cannot directly message other users who don’t share any channels with them, however, DMs (direct messages) are stored on the channel, allowing the admin of the channel to access messages between users, making channels easier to moderate.
Users can upload files up to 5GB.
Users are able to create/delete a channel.
Users have a built-in calendar that they can mark important dates/times on.
Channels can also have a calendar that can have important dates/times marked.
StudySphere will have an easy-to-use, convenient UI for both desktops and phones.
If they want to, users can customise the UI.
Will have robust voice/video sharing call functionality, ideal for giving lectures.
Set so only specific people can unmute at certain times.
This feature can be turned off at will by the lecturer during lectures to allow students to ask questions.
Can automatically record video calls to easily archive lectures, and automatically add them to the academic resource library (discussed later in unique features).

User Permissions/Channel Settings:
Able to set permissions on a channel, such as making lecturers moderators etc.
Moderator permissions allow the use of moderation tools - banning etc.
Able to add/remove plugins to channels as a moderator.
Plugins can be added to customise the functionality of channels, if users want extra functionality that is not included in the base software.
Users can join/be invited to channels.
Voice calls can be set to only allow specific users, or users who meet certain criteria.
For example, only users who have their cameras on can join a meeting.
Channels can be set to different privacy permissions, depending on the aim of the channel.
Setting the channel to “public” will allow any user to join without an invitation.
Setting the channel to “private” will only allow invited users to join. Good for channels for individual classes.
Setting the channel to “members only” will only allow users associated with the channel’s selected universities/colleges to join. Good for channels for university-wide clubs.

Other Unique Features:
Each channel will come with an academic resource library that can be used for uploading files to share with other users on the channel, which can be subdivided into different categories (similar to a smaller built-in version of Moodle)
For example, categories for assignment/lab submissions, others for lecture notes/videos.
Permissions can be set for who can see the uploaded files, max file size uploaded per user and who can upload files in the first place.
Supports many different file types.

Subscription Features:
Messages will always remain on channels forever, even without a subscription, as opposed to disappearing in 90 days like on the free version of Slack.
This will convince users to switch from Slack, as this is a common complaint from lecturers/universities using Slack.
Universities/other organisations can subscribe for additional features for all their channels/related accounts.
This will be much cheaper than Slack’s expensive €8.75 per user each month minimum subscription fee, making it affordable for universities that are not willing to pay as much as businesses (Slack’s main target demographic) for a communication service.
Subscribing allows more data to be stored on academic resource libraries, going from 20GB to 200GB.
Increased interactivity during online lectures/voice calls, such as the ability to hold quizzes similar to sites such as Kahoot!.
Users can sign up to the student version of StudySphere using their student email to receive some benefits from the subscription.
Universities/other organisations subscribed to StudySphere can get direct support from StudySphere’s support team between 09:00-17:00 on weekdays.
Universities/other organisations can also pay to train their employees to quickly set up StudySphere accounts and more efficiently use other aspects of StudySphere.
Student accounts can also have a personal area where they can write notes or upload files (max 5GB) to themselves.

This list of features was derived from matching the features that Slack and Discord provide, alongside adding extra features to set us apart from them.
